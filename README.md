# Personalized Travel Itinerary Optimizer (Python) :
--------------------------------------------
Built a Python-based system to optimize travel itineraries using advanced graph algorithms. Modeled attractions and travel times as a weighted graph and implemented multiple pathfinding techniques including:

BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s, A* Search, Hill Climbing, and Genetic Algorithm

Developed an interactive UI for selecting start/end points and desired algorithm

Visualized graph structures and shortest paths for better user experience and decision-making
